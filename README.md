## Stack

The bot is built using **.NET** and **C#**, using the [Discord.NET](https://docs.discordnet.dev/index.html) library . **Nunit** is used for unit testing. Hosted on a VPS.

## Motivation

This bot was created to provide CS2 players with an all-in-one utility tool for enhancing their experience outside of the game. As an avid CS2 player myself, I wanted to combine key stats and information services from a range of platforms (Steam, ESEA, FACEIT), and provide access to these from a single interface.
